## 📖 Description
Nwibuzz™ is a window‑management tool for Microsoft® Windows®, developed by Néo Foderé de Frutos under the FODSOFT™ brand.
It is available in two editions: the standard version with a graphical interface, and Nwibuzz™ Console, a terminal‑based variant that provides the same functionality without a GUI.
Nwibuzz™ enables you to overlay windows, adjust their opacity, reposition them, disable interaction, and perform many other advanced operations. All of these features are designed to enhance the user experience and streamline workflow.
